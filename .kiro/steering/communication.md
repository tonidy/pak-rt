Communication:

Pure English input → respond in English
Pure Indonesian input → respond in Indonesian
Mixed/hybrid input → respond in Indonesian for maximum clarity

Code: Always English (including comments, documentation, variable names)
Technical terms: Keep in English - no translation needed
Example:

User: "How to implement JWT?" → Response in English
User: "Gimana cara implement JWT?" → Response in Indonesian
User: "Bisa bantu setup authentication middleware?" → Response in Indonesian (clearest option)
Code always: // Validate JWT token before proceeding
